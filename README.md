Combine enchantment books to achieve levels above vanilla

## How it works
This plugin allows you to combine enchantments, e.g. Efficiency V + Efficiency V = Efficiency VI. This is done by using an anvil.

You can configure which enchantments can be combined above the Vanilla Minecraft levels. You can set the max level for each enchantment, and add XP cost in levels.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plugin requires [AnvilUnlocker](https://github.com/Jikoo/AnvilUnlocker/releases/latest) for anvil costs above 40 lvl.

## Permissions

> [!NOTE]
> `<echantment>` is the enchantment ID, e.g. `swift_sneak`, `efficiency`, etc. Replace with `*` for all enchantments.
>
> Example: `enchantbookplus.enchant.*` or `enchantbookplus.enchant.unbreaking`

| Permission                              | Description                                                                            |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `enchantbookplus.enchant.<enchantment>` | Allow enchanting `<enchantment>` above the vanilla level, as configured in the plugin. |
| `enchantbookplus.reload`                | Reload plugin config using `/enchantbookplus reload`                                   |
